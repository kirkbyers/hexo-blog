I got a Pokemon Go Plus a few months back. I've been off and on playing Pokemon Go for a little while, but I've been more since I got the Go Plus. So far, I'm really enjoying it. However, I thin $30 is still a little steep.

I'm definitely exercising more. The Go Plus makes it way more convenient to play Pokemon Go in general. I can loot a pokestops (now gyms too) and catch pokemon with a single button press without staring at my phone constantly. The price of this convenience though is decreasing my chances of successfully catching pokemon. 

What wasn't clear when I first started to use the Go Plus was that when you use the device to attempt to catch a pokemon, the device throws 1 normal pokeball that always "hits". If that throw doesn't succeed, the pokemon runs. In addition, the device will only throw normal pokeballs. I don't have exact numbers, but around level 20 I found that I get far more great balls than normal pokeballs from pokestops. If I use the device heavily (about hour long sessions 3-5 times a week), I'll run out of pokeballs very quickly. Once the pokeballs are gone I can either A) pay for more pokeballs ($1 for 20) or B) go back to playing the game as if I didn't have a Go Plus.

Overall, I'm enjoying the game now due to the Go Plus rather than to the updates. I am spending more on the game now. I'm keeping an eye on it, but so far its been around $5 a month. For now I'm enjoying the anniversary event and I'm looking forward to more updates.
