# Projects

Projects that I've worked on professionaly and personally.

## [Portfolio in Angular 2.0.0-rc.4](https://kbyedev.com)

As an eager adopter of Angular 2, I created a version of my portfolio in RC4 of Angular 2.

While Angular2 is not necessary to serve mostly static content, I am very interested in the community around the framework. In addition, this was my first project using TypeScript. I used Webpack to bundle assests as this project was made pre-angular-cli.

July 2016 - August 2016

## [Attaq Online Tournament Platform](https://play.attaqonline.com/)
A web app that automates the formation, progression, and payout of tournaments for eSports. Currently League of Legends is the only game supported.

I worked with a small team to create this Single Page Application using Angular 1.5 for the UI. We leveraged SenecaJs, a Node microservice framework, on the back-end. The app is not optimized on mobile due to the nature of the game supported.

Notable contributions:
    - Sole frontend developer
    - Integrated ads and multiple 3rd party payment options to create multiple revenu streams
    - Worked with 3rd party vendors to enhance user account features to save development time and increase user security

November 2015 - September 2016

## Attaq Online Stats (No longer available) 

A Single Page App that provides detailed stats for the game League of Legends.

I entered the project near the inital launch. I was mentored and guided through using client-side frameworks in a team enviornment. After launch, I was responsible for adding new features and maintaining the application. 

Notable contributions:
    - Reduce number of matches pulled per new player to increase scale to handle larger bursts of traffic. Statistically, this method kept the validity of the results while allowing us to serve 2x - 10x the number of users (depending on time in the competitive game season)

July 2015 - November 2015

## Computational Physics: Pseudo-Random Number Generators 

Replicated published tests and results from Testing Pseudo-Random Number Generators using a 2D Ising Model.

January 2015 - May 2015

## [Mitchell Institute at Texas A&M](http://mitchell.tamu.edu/) 

The home domain for the Mitchell Institute.

As a student technician, I developed and maintained Wordpress themes and installs on a small team. We were responsible for migrating content over from static sites, and bringing the content to this central site. The project evolved into user management.

Notable contributions:
    - Developed Wordpress tooling to increase faculty content creation resulting in over a 10x user base growth
    - Automated Student Technician responsibilities using Python

June 2013 - May 2015
