# Projects

Projects that I've worked on professionaly and personally.

## [Portfolio in Angular 2.0.0-rc.4](https://kbyedev.com)

As an eager adopter of Angular 2, I created a version of my portfolio in RC4 of Angular 2.

While Angular2 is not necessary to serve mostly static content, I am very interested in the community around the framework. In addition, this was my first project using TypeScript. I look forward to doing more with TypeScript. I used Webpack to bundle assests and NPM as my task runner.

July 2016 - August 2016

## [Attaq Online Tournament Platform](https://play.attaqonline.com/)
A web app that automates the formation, progression, and payout of tournaments for eSports. Currently League of Legends is the only game supported.

I worked with a small team to create this Single Page Application using Angular 1.5 for the UI. We leveraged SenecaJs, a Node microservice framework, on the back-end. The app is not optimized on mobile due to the nature of the game supported.

November 2015 - September 2016

## Attaq Online Stats (No longer available) 

A Single Page App that provides detailed stats for the game League of Legends.

I entered the project near the inital launch. I was mentored and guided through using client-side frameworks in a team enviornment. After launch, I was responsible for adding new features and maintaining the application. The application currently lives on the company's home domain due to bussiness reasons.

July 2015 - November 2015

## [Mitchell Institute at Texas A&M](http://mitchell.tamu.edu/) 

The home domain for the Mitchell Institute.

As a student technician, I developed and maintained Wordpress themes and installs on a small team. 
We were responsible for migrating content over from static sites, and bringing the content to this central site. 
The project evolved into user management.

June 2013 - May 2015
